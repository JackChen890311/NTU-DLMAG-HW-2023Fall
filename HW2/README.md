I did not complete this homework due to time limitation. However, here are some repositories I found, maybe they will be useful for this task:
- [HiFi-GAN](https://github.com/jik876/hifi-gan)
- [iSTFTNet](https://github.com/rishikksh20/iSTFTNet-pytorch)

(But they are not easy to reproduce, at least not easy for me lol)

However, if you're interested in the Grffin-Lim Algorithm, you can check griffin-lim.ipynb to see how I did it.

## TODO
- update this readme
